<h2>Beliefs</h2>

<p><strong>Intellectual honesty is rare and decisive.</strong><br>
Most people are trained to avoid conflict and defend status, which quietly kills correction. If you are willing to say the uncomfortable thing, update in public, and tolerate tension, that advantage compounds faster than talent. Truth pays interest.</p>

<p><strong>Curiosity is alpha.</strong><br>
Pulling on loose threads compounds across domains. Most people think in borrowed narratives. Curiosity is how you step outside them, notice problems early, learn faster, and abandon models that no longer work.</p>

<p><strong>Institutions exist for real reasons, then drift.</strong><br>
They are good at continuity and coordination, and bad at truth once blame becomes the core product. Process starts as a way to work together and slowly turns into liability management. When defensibility beats correctness, learning stops.</p>

<p><strong>Coordination costs grow faster than capability.</strong><br>
Past a certain size, adding people mostly adds friction. Communication and politics quietly dominate output. AI sharply increases individual leverage, which makes coordination, not intelligence, the binding constraint and shifts advantage toward small, aligned teams with clear judgment.</p>

<p><strong>Talent and competence are unevenly distributed. That is empirical, not ideological.</strong><br>
The right response is not to anoint the best people and hand them authority. It is to stop building systems that insulate poor decisions from feedback. Markets, competition, and accountability sort this faster and more fairly than any selection committee.</p>

<p><strong>Stagnation is indefensible.</strong><br>
People who oppose economic and technical progress are confused about where prosperity comes from. Entrepreneurship and competition are the only engines we have found that reliably produce progress, and we still need a lot more of it. Freezing the world as it is just locks in today's failures.</p>

<p><strong>The world needs more entrepreneurship than it has.</strong><br>
Progress comes from people who put capital, time, and reputation at risk and let results decide. If there is no downside, no accountability, and no chance of failure, it is not entrepreneurship. We need far more of this than we currently have.</p>

<p><strong>Fast feedback beats correct theory.</strong><br>
Ideas that hit reality early converge faster than ideas that start out right but update slowly. The speed of correction matters more than initial accuracy.</p>

<p><strong>Conviction filters noise.</strong><br>
Without it, speed turns into thrashing instead of progress. In environments flooded with information and leverage, beliefs need to be held steady long enough to be tested. Conviction is not stubbornness. It is the temporary suspension of doubt that makes action and learning possible.</p>

<p><strong>Human potential is massively underutilized.</strong><br>
Our systems are built for control and legibility, not leverage. Technical constraints still force zero sum tradeoffs that suppress initiative. Better tools and real abundance expand what people can attempt. Better systems decide whether that capacity shows up.</p>

<p><strong>Growth is real under the right conditions.</strong><br>
Even traits we treat as fixed, like work ethic, ambition, and risk tolerance, respond strongly to incentives, expectations, and social context. Humans are social animals. When effort compounds and ownership is real, people grow. When it does not, they rationally stop trying.</p>

<p><strong>Agency is a product of system design.</strong><br>
People act when they have ownership, real consequences, and upside. Change incentives, norms, and decision rights and behavior shifts, often dramatically. This is the highest leverage place to intervene.</p>
