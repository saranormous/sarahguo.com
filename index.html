<h2>Beliefs</h2>

<p><strong>Intellectual honesty is rare and decisive.</strong><br>
People are trained to avoid conflict and defend status, which kills correction. Saying the uncomfortable thing, updating in public, and tolerating tension compounds faster than talent. Truth pays interest.</p>

<p><strong>Curiosity is alpha.</strong><br>
Pulling on loose threads compounds across domains. Most people think in borrowed narratives. Curiosity is how you step outside them, notice problems early, learn fast, and abandon dead models before they fossilize.</p>

<p><strong>Institutions exist for real reasons, then drift.</strong><br>
They are good at continuity and coordination, and terrible at truth once blame becomes the core product. Process starts as a way to work together and ends as liability management. The moment defensibility beats correctness, learning dies.</p>

<p><strong>Coordination costs grow faster than capability.</strong><br>
Past a certain size, adding people mostly adds friction. Communication and politics quietly dominate output. AI sharply increases individual leverage, which makes coordination, not intelligence, the binding constraint and pushes advantage toward small, aligned teams with clear judgment.</p>

<p><strong>Talent and competence are unevenly distributed. That is empirical, not ideological.</strong><br>
The right response is not to designate who is best and hand them authority. It is to stop building systems that insulate poor decisions from feedback. Markets, competition, and accountability sort this faster and more fairly than any selection committee.</p>

<p><strong>The world runs on power laws.</strong><br>
The tails drive outcomes. The middle absorbs effort. Optimizing averages feels responsible and explains almost nothing.</p>

<p><strong>Stagnation is indefensible.</strong><br>
People who oppose economic and technical progress are confused about where prosperity comes from. Entrepreneurship and competition are the only engines that reliably produce progress, and we still need a lot more of it. Freezing the world as it is just locks in existing failures.</p>

<p><strong>The world needs more entrepreneurs than it has.</strong><br>
Not as a job title, but as a way of thinking. Ownership over excuses. Action without permission. Accountability for outcomes. Progress is bottlenecked on this mindset being too rare.</p>

<p><strong>Variance beats error minimization.</strong><br>
Avoiding visible mistakes trades significance for respectability. When upside is asymmetric, playing it safe is the expensive choice.</p>

<p><strong>Fast feedback beats correct theory.</strong><br>
Ideas that hit reality early converge faster than ideas that start right but update slowly. Correction speed matters more than initial accuracy.</p>

<p><strong>Conviction filters noise.</strong><br>
Without it, speed produces thrashing instead of progress. In environments flooded with information and leverage, beliefs have to be held steady long enough to be tested. Conviction is not stubbornness. It is the temporary suspension of doubt required to act, coordinate, and learn.</p>

<p><strong>Cults are powerful coordination technologies.</strong><br>
Small groups with intense shared beliefs move faster and try stranger things than broad, low commitment coalitions. High trust and clear doctrine beat consensus when you are trying to make something exist.</p>

<p><strong>Human potential is massively underutilized.</strong><br>
Our systems are built for control and legibility, not leverage, while technical constraints still force zero sum tradeoffs that suppress initiative. Better tools and real abundance expand what people can attempt. Better systems determine whether that capacity is expressed. We are far from either limit.</p>

<p><strong>Growth is real under the right conditions.</strong><br>
Even traits we treat as fixed, like work ethic, ambition, and risk tolerance, respond strongly to incentives, expectations, and social context. Humans are social animals. When effort compounds, ownership is real, and upside exists, people grow. When it does not, they rationally stop trying. Most stagnation is learned.</p>

<p><strong>Agency is a product of system design.</strong><br>
People act when they have ownership, real consequences, and upside. Change incentives, norms, and decision rights and behavior shifts, often dramatically. This is the highest leverage place to intervene.</p>
